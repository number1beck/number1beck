- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @number1beck or Beck, whichever works. I am a U.S. Army verteran, who currently works as a Database Administrator. I work mostly with Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), but I also work with MySQL, MongoDB, Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Linux, as well. I am currently working on breaking into coding side of the tech world. I enjoy exploring and learning new tech, I like to mountian biking, snowboarding, spending time with my family, and hiking. I am also into cars and currently own a 2019 Volkswagen GTI. I currently live in Pennsylvania, but I lived in Hawaii while in the military. I would love to move back to Hawaii some day. I miss the weather and the atmosphere of Hawaii life. 


- I have picked up T-SQL during my 6 years as a DBA, and I am currently working on learning Swift for IOS development. I really enjoy Apple products and the thought of developing IOS apps for people to use in everyday life interests me, that is why I decided to learn Swift as my next coding language. I plan to keep learning once I have learn Swift, I plan on learning web development after IOS development. Once I started looking into coding, it did not take me long to realize I really enjoyed it. My goal is to learn coding and transition my career into a developer once, and then keep learning different coding languages. I love learning new things.
